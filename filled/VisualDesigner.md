# Visual Designer
### Remote with occasional trips to Hartford, CT

At Bloom, we partner with state and local governments to design and build digital services. We **make government work** like we all think it should, **fix services**  that have become siloed or ineffective, and **increase the digital muscle of the organizations we work with** so they have the capacity to build and own their own tech futures.   

We are looking for an experienced visual designer to join us in delivering user-centered products and services. Design is at the core of services that are welcoming and accessible. We’re looking for someone who can work tightly with UX researchers, developers, and subject matter experts to improve the visual identity of the work we do and develop a design system as we go.

### About the project
We’ve partnered with the State of Connecticut to build and improve services critical to families with young children, and stand up a digital service team ready to roll with projects that will most improve services for high needs populations. We’re working with the Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Early Childhood to make Connecticut a shining example of what’s possible when we build (or rebuild) services from citizen’s needs upwards. 

### In this role, you will 
- **Manage all aspects of visual design** as part of a cross functional delivery team, including project design reviews, prototyping, and execution for all project work related to visual design
- **Work collaboratively with our UX and Content team members** to create intuitive, clear and beautiful products
- **Produce visual designs for a variety of media**, including digital services, storyboards, and physical assets 
- **Work with user flows, journey maps, and/or subject matter experts** to create modular design components, and mockups
- **Build a cohesive and flexible design standard** to bring a brand and visual identity to the products and services
- **Develop strategies and toolkits that empower government partners** to implement design standards in a consistent way
- **Incorporate best practices in accessible design** to ensure services and products are designed with inclusivity from the ground up
- **Provide guidance on existing assets as needed**
- **Be willing to move forward despite ambiguity** - we don't always have a roadmap


### We’re looking for
- **At least three years of professional experience** creating visual designs as part of a cross functional team
- **Passion for building visual designs** that are accessible and flexible to adapt to changing needs
- **Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills**. Relationship builder who enjoys working with a variety of people and functions. You should be able to listen, ask questions to discern the true nature of problems, and synthesize needs (from internal and external stakeholders).
- **Strong organizational skills**. Ability to manage multiple projects, meet deadlines under pressure, and collaborate with a distributed team.
- **Experience working in an agile, iterative way.**
- **Positive attitude and a sense of humor**. Empathetic, collaborative, and able to adapt in the face of constraints.

### How to apply
There are a variety of roles and ways to join this project. If you think you’re a good fit please send a resume and brief introduction to hello@govbloom.com. 

If you live in the Hartford, Connecticut area and are interested in joining the Connecticut Digital Service we will soon be posting roles for these positions as well.

At Bloom, we care deeply about diversity and inclusion, and believe our team is strongest when we bring  a wide variety of experiences and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
