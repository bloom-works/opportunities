# Role: Data Engineer 
#### Location: Remote with travel to Hartford, CT

Our mission is to create human-centered government. We’re a coalition of digital gov alums who partner with state and local governments to design and build digital services that improve people’s lives. We help our government partners build internal, sustainable capacity to transform how they do business.   

We are looking for an experienced Data Engineer to work on a cross-functional team — that includes our government partners — to transform the way they intake, manage, share, and use data. This effort is part of a larger partnership with the State of Connecticut to help them stand up a digital service team with an initial focus on services for families and young children. 

**In this role, you will**
- Explore existing data processes and systems to identify gaps, risks, and opportunities for improvement
- Write code to facilitate data extraction, sharing, and matching in a secure, reliable way
- Plan and build data integrations between systems
- Quickly prototype solutions to prove out the technical feasibility of a solution and test whether it meets user needs
- Apply your expertise to help model structured and unstructured data
- Help teach other team members (technical and non-technical) about data architecture, and also be a consultant for developers who need help with data
- Understand the available architectures and technologies, assess the options
- Be pragmatic: look at what’s possible and make informed tradeoffs in order to make incremental progress towards the ultimate goal
- Implement strategies for building capacity with our State partners for responsible data practices 
- Be fully engaged on a cross-functional team of designers, developers, and subject matter experts to build and ship products and services — this includes attending standups, retrospective meetings, and contributing to weekly updates
- Work in close partnership with government teams to transfer knowledge throughout the course of the project
- Creatively navigate bureaucratic challenges, paving the way for more intuitive processes in the future
- Collaborate with government partners to ensure compatibility with existing processes and technologies
- Demonstrate a passion for learning, embrace change, and ask insightful questions particularly about culture, business needs, and IT capabilities

**What we're looking for**
- At least 5 years of experience in this domain
- Experience working as part of a cross functional team 
- Strong programming experience in Python or Java 
- Extensive experience working with relational databases 
- Experience designing and implementing scalable RESTful APIs
- Proven ability to apply modern software engineering principles and practices
- Desire to take a project from start to finish
- Strong organizational skills and attention to detail
- Ability to communicate clearly and increase transparency, with a strong competency in situational awareness and conflict resolution
- An adaptive, thoughtful, and collaborative mindset
