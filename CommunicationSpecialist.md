# Communication Specialist
### Remote with occasional trips to Hartford, CT

At Bloom, we partner with state and local governments to design and build digital services. We **make government work** like we all think it should, **fix services**  that have become siloed or ineffective, and **increase the digital muscle of the organizations we work with** so they have the capacity to build and own their own tech futures.   

We are looking for an experienced communication specialist to join a cross-functional team to deliver user-centered products and services using iterative design and modern software development practices. We’re deliberate about creating a remote team and culture, though we place a lot of value in travelling to be in-person with our government partners on a somewhat regular basis. 

### About the project
