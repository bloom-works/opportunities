# Sr Software Engineer
### Remote with occasional trips to Hartford, CT

At Bloom, we partner with state and local governments to design and build digital services. We **make government work** like we all think it should, **fix services**  that have become siloed or ineffective, and **increase the digital muscle of the organizations we work with** so they have the capacity to build and own their own tech futures.   

We are looking for an experienced engineer to join a cross-functional team to deliver user-centered products and services using iterative design and modern software development practices. We’re deliberate about creating a remote team and culture, though we place a lot of value in travelling to be in-person with our government partners on a somewhat regular basis. 

### About the project
We’ve partnered with the State of Connecticut to build and improve services critical to families with young children, and stand up a digital service team ready to roll with projects that will most improve services for high needs populations. We’re working with the Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Early Childhood to make Connecticut a shining example of what’s possible when we build (or rebuild) services from citizen’s needs upwards. 

### In this role, you will 
- **Work on a cross functional team** of designers, developers, and subject matter experts to build and ship products and services. This includes daily standups, retrospective meetings, and providing weekly updates.
- **Establish and uphold best practices** for the team that improve overall code quality, maintainability, security, and team collaboration and productivity.
- **Design and develop prototypes to rapidly test potential approaches.**
- **Build major functionality that is mission critical for high-need populations.**
- **Participate in planning** and breaking down requirements into tasks.
- **Systematically debug and resolve issues** when they occur.
- **Review code** and provide feedback.
- **Propose new tools and practices**, while understanding that, in this environment, at times the decisions around tools lie outside of our control.
- **Work in close partnership with government teams** to transfer skills and product knowledge throughout the course of the project.
- **Participate and value user feedback**, embrace working iteratively and incorporating learnings along the way.

### We’re looking for
- At least five years of professional experience as a software engineer on a cross functional team.
- Experience shipping products in an agile environment.
- Passion for using technology to improve the experience of government services.
- Exceptional interpersonal skills. Relationship builder who enjoys working with a variety of people and functions. You should be able to listen, ask questions to discern the true nature of problems, and synthesize needs (from internal and external stakeholders) into an actionable product roadmap.
- Extensive experience using analytical and creative thinking to solve problems.
- Strong organizational skills. Ability to manage multiple projects and meet deadlines under pressure. 
- Excellent written and oral communication skills. 
- Positive attitude and a sense of humor. Empathetic, collaborative, and able to adapt in the face of constraints.
- Experience with iterative product development and human centered design practices

### How to apply
There are a variety of roles and ways to join this project. If you think you’re a good fit please send a resume and brief introduction to hello@govbloom.com. 

If you live in the Hartford, Connecticut area and are interested in joining the Connecticut Digital Service we will soon be posting roles for these positions as well.

At Bloom, we care deeply about diversity and inclusion, and believe our team is strongest when we bring  a wide variety of experiences and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

We look forward to hearing from you!
