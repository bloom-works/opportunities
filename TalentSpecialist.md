Our mission is to create human-centered government.

We help our government partners build internal, sustainable capacity to transform how they do business.   

We are looking for an experienced Talent Specialist to work on a cross-functional team — that includes our government partners — to deliver better outcomes for stakeholders. We’re partnering with the State of Connecticut to help them stand up a digital service team with an initial focus on services for families and young children.

- **Implement strategies for building digital service capacity** among the existing workforce
- **Develop a playbook** with the State of Connecticut to modernize their workforce.
- **Troubleshoot hiring and staffing** around requirements, a retiring workforce, etc.
- **Be fully engaged on a cross-functional team** of designers, developers, and subject matter experts to build and ship products and services. This includes attending standups, retrospective meetings, and contributing to weekly updates.
- **Work in close partnership with government teams** to transfer knowledge throughout the course of the project
- **Creatively navigate bureaucratic challenges**, paving the way for more intuitive processes in the future
- **Collaborate with government partners** to ensure compatibility with existing processes and technologies
- **Demonstrate a passion for learning**, embrace change, and ask insightful questions particularly about culture, business needs, and IT capabilities

### We’re looking for
- At least 3 years of experience in this domain
- Comfort in an environment optimized for product delivery: you will be part of a product team and we believe talent is a product
- Familiarity modernizing talent practices alongside unions, and union requirements
- Knowledge for improvements or experiments done in other organizations with respect to modernizing the workforce
- Desire to take a project from start to finish
- Strong organizational skills and attention to detail
- Ability to communicate clearly and increase transparency, with a strong competency in situational awareness and conflict resolution
