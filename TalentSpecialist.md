# Talent Specialist
### Remote with occasional trips to Hartford, CT

At Bloom, we partner with state and local governments to design and build digital services. We **make government work** like we all think it should, **fix services**  that have become siloed or ineffective, and **increase the digital muscle of the organizations we work with** so they have the capacity to build and own their own tech futures.   

We are looking for an experienced Talent Specialist to work on a cross-functional team to work collaboratively with our government partners to deliver better outcomes for those they serve. We’ve partnered with the State of Connecticut to help them stand up a digital service team with an initial focus on services for families and young children. 

### About the project
We’ve partnered with the State of Connecticut to build and improve services critical to families with young children, and stand up a digital service team ready to roll with projects that will most improve services for high needs populations. We’re working with the Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Early Childhood to make Connecticut a shining example of what’s possible when we build (or rebuild) services from citizen’s needs upwards. 

### In this role, you will 
- **Identify gap to increase digital service capacity** in existing resources and talent-related processes (e.g., hiring, onboarding)
- **Build support for incorporating modern job descriptions and hiring practices in government**, while honoring policies regarding unions, EEO, etc.
- **Implement strategies for building digital service capacity** among the existing workforce
- **Develop a playbook** with the State of Connecticut to modernize their workforce.
- **Troubleshoot hiring and staffing** around requirements, a retiring workforce, etc.
- **Be fully engaged on a cross-functional team** of designers, developers, and subject matter experts to build and ship products and services. This includes attending standups, retrospective meetings, and contributing to weekly updates.
- **Work in close partnership with government teams** to transfer knowledge throughout the course of the project
- **Creatively navigate bureaucratic challenges**, paving the way for more intuitive processes in the future
- **Collaborate with government partners** to ensure compatibility with existing processes and technologies
- **Demonstrate a passion for learning**, embrace change, and ask insightful questions particularly about culture, business needs, and IT capabilities

### We’re looking for
- At least 3 years of experience in this domain, and ideally time spent working to modernize talent practices in a unionized environment 
- Knowledge for improvements or experiments done in other organizations with respect to modernizing the workforce
- Strong organizational skills and attention to detail
- Ability to communicate clearly and increase transparency, with a strong competency in situational awareness and conflict resolution
- An adaptive, proactive, empathetic, tenacious, and positive mindset
