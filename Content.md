# Content Writer/Strategist
### Remote with occasional trips to Hartford, CT

At Bloom, we partner with state and local governments to design and build digital services. We **make government work** like we all think it should, **fix services**  that have become siloed or ineffective, and **increase the digital muscle of the organizations we work with** so they have the capacity to build and own their own tech futures.   

We are looking for an experienced content writer and strategist to join us in delivering user-centered products and services. We believe content is core to making services discoverable and useful. We’re looking for someone who can work tightly with UX researchers, developers, and subject matter experts to distill highly complex processes into accessible information.

We’re deliberate about creating a remote team and culture, though we place a lot of value in traveling to be in-person with our government partners on a somewhat regular basis. 

### About the project
We’ve partnered with the State of Connecticut to build and improve services critical to families with young children, and stand up a digital service team ready to work alongside us. We’re working with the Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Early Childhood to make Connecticut an example of what’s possible when we build (or rebuild) services from constituents’ needs upward. 

### In this role, you will 
- **Work on a cross functional team** of designers, developers, and subject matter experts to build and ship products and services. This includes daily standups, retrospective meetings, and providing weekly updates.
- **Design, write, and edit content** for a variety of products and services
- **Collaborate with subject matter experts** to understand complexities in their processes, and **meet with users** to learn from the ways they interact with information
- **Implement content governance practices** that help our partners achieve their goals while being mindful of resource constraints
- **Incorporate diverse perspectives** from a variety of user groups and stakeholders; when necessary build consensus with creative approaches, strong communication, data, and positivity 
- **Mentor and provide training**
- **Establish performance goals** to measure the effectiveness of content across a variety of media
- **Be willing to move forward despite ambiguity** - we don't always have a roadmap

### What we’re looking for
- **Extensive experience as a content writer and strategist** — this role will involve both — for large scale and long term projects
- **Passion for finding simplicity in impossibly complex information**
- **Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills.** Relationship builder who enjoys working with a variety of people and functions. You should be able to listen, ask questions to discern the true nature of problems, and synthesize needs (from internal and external stakeholders).
- **Extensive experience using analytical and creative thinking to solve problems**
- **Strong organizational skills.** Ability to manage multiple projects, meet deadlines under pressure, and collaborate with a distributed team.
- **Experience working in an agile, iterative way**
- **Positive attitude and a sense of humor.** Empathetic, collaborative, and able to adapt in the face of constraints.
